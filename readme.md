# Nervous system
"The sympathetic branch is regarded as the “fight or flight” system, getting us ready to act, react and perform, while the parasympathetic side is often characterized as the “rest and digest” system. Both systems typically function simultaneously, but in opposition to each other, either activating or inhibiting specific physiological responses."

# Qualifications
To get the UKA coaching assistant it is a two day course turn up and you'll pass. The athletics coach is a bit more in depth and takes about 6 months to do. 4 days over three weekends. There is not much technical stuff I have picked that up from here and there it is more how to engage and get your message to athletes.
